# Pentatonic Scales: Major vs. Minor

## Overview
Understanding the differences between major and minor pentatonic scales and their applications in music, particularly in blues and bluegrass contexts.

## Major Pentatonic Scale
- Requires learning three different scales (one for each chord in a I-IV-V progression)
- Less commonly used in blues music
- More complex to apply across chord progressions

## Minor Pentatonic Scale
- **More commonly used in blues music**
- **Key advantage**: Knowing just one scale (minor pentatonic) allows covering three chords
- More versatile and practical for improvisation
- Single scale can work over I-IV-V progressions

## Application
- In blues contexts, the minor pentatonic is the go-to scale
- Understanding this relationship helps with chord-scale theory
- Knowing one scale pattern can cover multiple chords in a progression

## Related Concepts
