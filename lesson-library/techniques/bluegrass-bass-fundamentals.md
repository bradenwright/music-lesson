# Bluegrass Bass Fundamentals

## Core Concepts

### Basic Building Blocks
- **Root notes**: Foundation of bass playing in bluegrass
- **Fifths**: Second most important interval after root
- **Octaves**: Third fundamental interval to master

### Progression Strategy
Start with simple 2-4 note walks between chords, then gradually introduce more complex techniques.

### Practice Approach
- Practice singing/humming root notes while playing
- Play along with recordings to develop ear
- Focus on pitch and tone rather than specific letter names

## Exercises

### Lesson 1 Exercises

## Teaching Philosophy
- Emphasis on ear training over memorization
- Knowing how to hum or play a scale by ear is more important than memorizing syllables or specific notes
- Focus on developing jamming skills through practice
