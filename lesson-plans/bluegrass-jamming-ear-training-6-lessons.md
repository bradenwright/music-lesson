## Lesson 1 – Bluegrass Groove & Foundations

**Focus**: Boom-chick groove, root/fifth motion, and singing roots while you play.

### Warm-up
- Root-fifth-octave in G, C, D, A

### Songs
- Dark Hollow
- Nellie Kane

### Practice
- Begin singing root names aloud with each chord change

---

## Lesson 2 – Ear Training I: Hearing Chord Changes

**Focus**: Train your ear on I–IV–V progressions and start calling changes out loud.

### Songs
- Going Down the Road Feeling Bad
- I'll Fly Away

### Practice
- **"Call and sing"**: Teacher plays, you sing roots before playing

---

## Lesson 3 – Connecting Roots & Three-Note Walks

**Focus**: Smooth transitions between chords with 3-note approaches on beats 3-4-&.

### Pattern Template

```
Count → 1 2 3 4 & 1
Groove → walk note 1 walk note 2 walk note 3 → new root
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: G → C
```
Count    1   2   3   4   &   1
Notes    G   D   A   B   C   C
```
- A → B → C is a scale walk (G major)
- Sing "C" (the next root) as you play A-B-C

#### Example 2: C → D
```
Count    1   2   3   4   &   1
Notes    C   G   A   B♭  C   D
```
- You're aiming for C → C# → D, but starting earlier allows a smoother, longer motion
- Alternate option (chromatic): A → B → C# → D

#### Example 3: D → G
```
Count    1   2   3   4   &   1
Notes    D   A   C   B   A   G
```
- The C–B–A line gives a nice descending release

### Practice Drill
- Loop G–C–D–G
- On beats 1–2: root/fifth groove
- On beats 3–4–&: play your three approach notes
- Land the new root exactly on beat 1
- Sing the new root ("C!" "D!" "G!") before your fingers land

### Homework
- Record each transition three times at slow tempo
- Make sure the last walk note hits on "& of 4"
- Try alternate versions (all scale-based, all chromatic)

---

## Lesson 4 – Melodic Fills & Expanded Walks

**Focus**: Turn 3-note walks into musical fills.

### Techniques
- Add rhythmic variation (swing eighths, triplets)
- Experiment with combining 3-note walks + rhythmic embellishment

### Songs
- Nellie Kane
- Cold Rain and Snow

### Jam Drill
- 8 bars groove → 4 bars fill → repeat

### Homework
- Record yourself and note where your fills sound natural vs. forced

---

## Lesson 5 – Jam Practice & Ear Training II

**Focus**: React in real-time and choose the right walk by ear.

### Practice Format
- Instructor calls random changes (I–IV–V)
- You respond with an appropriate 3-note walk (scale or chromatic)

### Songs
- Big River
- Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms

### Practice
- Add singing: anticipate the next root vocally before playing it

### Homework
- Use a G-major jam track, adding 3-note walks between chords
- Identify and sing the next root each time before landing it

---

## Lesson 6 – Putting It All Together

**Focus**: Full-song jamming, combining groove, fills, and ear.

### Practice
- Play Dark Hollow and GDTRFB start-to-finish with 3-note transitions
- **"Blind jam" test**: Identify the key by ear and join confidently
- Reflect on groove, tone, and consistency

### Homework / Next Steps
- Begin experimenting with 4-note walks
- Start hearing minor or dominant progressions by ear

---

## Song Pool

All songs fit beautifully with 3-note walk phrasing:
- Dark Hollow
- Nellie Kane
- Going Down the Road Feeling Bad
- I'll Fly Away
- Cold Rain and Snow
- Big River
- Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms

---

## Daily Practice Routine (10–15 min)

1. **Warm-Up**: Root–5th groove in G major
2. **Ear & Voice**: Sing the next root while playing the current chord
3. **Walks**: Add 3 approach notes (beats 3-4-&) → new root
4. **Jam**: Loop two chords and practice landing clean on 1
5. **Reflect**: Listen back; check that walks are even and in time
