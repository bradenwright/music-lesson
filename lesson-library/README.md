# Lesson Library

This directory contains a searchable knowledge base of music theory concepts, techniques, and insights extracted from lessons. The library is organized by topic areas and grows organically as new concepts are learned.

## Organization

The library is organized into folders by topic. Feel free to create new folders and reorganize as needed. Current structure:

- **scales-modes/**: Information about different scales, their characteristics, moods, and applications
- **harmony-theory/**: Concepts about chord progressions, resolution, tension, and key changes
- **techniques/**: Playing techniques, practice methods, and exercises
- **genres-styles/**: Genre-specific concepts (bluegrass, jazz, etc.)
- **ear-training/**: Methods and concepts for developing musical ear

## Adding New Content

When extracting concepts from lessons:
1. Identify the main topic area
2. Create or add to the appropriate folder
3. Use clear, descriptive filenames
4. Include context about when/where the concept was learned
5. Cross-reference related concepts when helpful
