# Songs

This directory contains songs covered in lessons, including notation, GuitarPro files, and related materials.

## Organization

Songs are organized by song name in individual folders. Each song folder contains:
- **README.md** or **song-info.md**: Information about the song, when it was covered, key, tempo, etc.
- **images/**: Screenshots and photos of music notation, chord charts, or other visual materials
- **guitarpro/**: GuitarPro files (.gp, .gp3, .gp4, .gp5, .gpx files)
- Any other related files (tabs, chord charts, etc.)
