# Lesson Plans

This directory contains structured lesson plans that span multiple sessions. Each lesson plan is a complete curriculum covering a specific topic or skill progression.

## Format

Lesson plans are organized as markdown files with:
- Overview and objectives
- Progress tracking section (links to actual lesson summaries)
- Individual lesson breakdowns
- Songs and exercises for each lesson
- Practice routines and homework assignments
- Song pools and reference materials

## Linking to Lesson Summaries

As you complete lessons that are part of a lesson plan, link to the actual lesson summaries in the progress tracking section. This creates a connection between the planned curriculum and what was actually covered.

**Example**:
```markdown
- **Lesson 1**: [2024-10-15](../lesson-summary/2024-10-15.md)
```

## Usage

Lesson plans can be referenced during lesson planning, used to track progress through a curriculum, and adapted for different students or skill levels.
