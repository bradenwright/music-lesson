# Lesson Summary - October 22, 2024

## Overview
This was Lesson 1 of the Bluegrass Jamming & Ear Training curriculum. The lesson focused on bluegrass groove foundations, root-fifth motion, and ear training. We worked on two songs: Dark Hollow (Grateful Dead version) and Nellie Kane (Hot Rize version), practicing chord identification and root note singing.

## Key Topics Discussed

### Song Work
- **Dark Hollow**: Grateful Dead version, played in key of A
- **Nellie Kane**: Hot Rize version, played in key of E with minor 6th chord
- Discussed chord progressions, timing, and structure
- Explored different versions of songs for reference

### Music Theory
- Major vs. minor pentatonic scales
- Minor pentatonic is more commonly used in blues music
- Understanding that knowing one scale (minor pentatonic) allows covering three chords
- Major pentatonic requires learning three different scales
- Chord progressions and scale relationships

### Ear Training
- Identifying 1, 4, 5 chords by sound
- Calling out chord changes while listening
- Practicing identifying I-IV-V progressions by ear
- Singing root names aloud before and during each chord change

### Technique Practice
- Root-fifth groove practice
- Staying in comfortable position while playing chords
- Working on consistent counting and timing
- Exploring different chord voicings and additional notes (like sevenths)
