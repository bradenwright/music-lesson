# Root Note Identification

## Concept
The ability to identify and play root notes by ear is fundamental to bass playing and musical understanding.

## Practice Methods

### Singing/Humming While Playing
- Practice singing or humming root notes while playing bass
- This develops the connection between ear and instrument
- Helps internalize the relationship between chords and their roots

### Playing Along with Recordings
- Play along with recordings while focusing on root notes
- Hum or sing the root notes as you play
- Develops ability to hear and identify roots in context

### Identifying I-IV-V Progressions
- Practice identifying 1, 4, 5 chords by sound
- Listen to music and call out chord changes to practice identifying I-IV-V progressions
- Sing root names aloud before and during each chord change while practicing
- Develops ability to hear chord progressions and anticipate changes

## Philosophy
- Focus on pitch and tone rather than specific letter names
- Knowing how to hum or play a scale by ear is more important than memorizing syllables or specific notes
- Ear training takes precedence over theoretical memorization

## Application
- Essential for bluegrass bass playing
- Foundation for improvisation
- Key skill for jamming with other musicians
